# eutariatoken

Eutaria is an off-chain game and play-to-earn crypto currency. The project is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network and requires players to hold the Eutaria token to unlock play-to-earn features.

Our goal is to provide players sustainable rewards and play-to-earn without gas fees. The earnings of players will be an in-game currency with a fixed value equivalent to USD. The earnings can be claimed and automatically converted to BNB. We are using a scalable cloud server for off-chain transactions that is highly secure and has an automatic backup
